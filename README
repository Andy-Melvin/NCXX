Loading the Extension into Chrome

Open Chrome.
Navigate to chrome://extensions/.
Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch located on the top right.
Click the Load unpacked button.
Browse and select the /NetworkControlExtension directory.

#How It Works

Once loaded, you'll find the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar.
Click the icon to access a popup (defined in popup.html), providing an interactive interface.
As you surf the web, the background.js script keeps track of all network requests, logging them for reference. Access these logs by:
Visiting chrome://extensions/.
Locating your extension.
Clicking the "background page" link.
To block specific requests or fine-tune network activity, enhance the logic in background.js.
Publishing (Optional)

To make your extension available on the Chrome Web Store:

Head to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
Click the Add a new item button.
Compress your /NetworkControlExtension directory into a ZIP file and upload.
Populate the necessary details such as description, screenshots, and so on.
There's a one-time developer fee; ensure you've cleared it.
Hit Publish to make your extension public!
